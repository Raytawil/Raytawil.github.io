 <center><p><h3> The Holy Land is my favorite place in the world!! I travel there with my family for winter vacation usually when we have a bar mitzvah to attend. It is great weather and there are beautiful sights such as the Dead Sea or the Kotel. An image of the Kotel can be seen in the image above.  </p></h3></center>

 <p><h3> I've went to Florida with my family for many years on Passover. It is great to be there and go to the beautiful beaches. The hotels there are awesome with their amazing pools and luxurious meals.  </p></h3>

 <p><h3> I've been to Aruba all my life, usually on winter vacation.It's so much fun to be there because there are so many things to do. You can go swimming in the pool or go tubing in the ocean or even play basketball on great courts. There are volleyball games going on every day on the beach and you can watch them or even play yourself with many of your friends.   </p></h3>
